# F28WP - The Dream Team

### Group: The Dream Team
### Aim: MMO/RPG style game

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/OliRadlett/f28wp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/OliRadlett/f28wp)

#### Plan:
1. We first discussed the project, and how many parts the game will take to 
   make
2. Divide parts, ability wise (everyone tried to contribute one way or another)
3. Meet-up weekly on Wednesday to discuss our progress and what can we do next
   if anyone needs helps we will orginise more meetings to help one another

#### Game idea:
1. Online multiplayer rpg style game where generated enemies with different level of difficulty and make them go against the player
1. enemies levels will be comparible with the player so the difficulty level will be reasonble 
1. Thinking about making a shop so players can buy HP or weapons but if it got complicated we have an alternative plan 
   we plan on making enemies throw weapons and HP after they die so players can loot them and hiding treasure boxes containing HP/weapons
1. Going to use pixel art
1. When it comes to music we either make something up using an app or we use free music online (depends on time and abilities)
1. Maybe each player will have a skills sheet which can improve when level up and get abilities 

Things we've done/working to improve:
1. Start menu with sliding background 
1. Working on improving enemy AI
1. Made the character selection page more interactive
1. The option menu now has sliders for the music volume
1. Added more images to use in the game such as heart, world map, skeleton...etc
2. Add a health = 100 to the player's contructor class
